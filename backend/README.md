Welcome to Imagine's home assignments repository! This repository is designed to provide Imagine fellows with an opportunity to practice technical home assignment tests, helping them overcome their concerns and gain confidence in their abilities to secure their dream job in Europe.

If you're new to Imagine and stumbled upon this repository, I encourage you to check out Imagine at [Imagine](https://www.joinimagine.com).

For Imagine fellows interested in practicing our home assignment tests, feel free to explore this repository and choose an assignment that matches your expertise.

**How does it work?**

1. Browse through the assignments based on your role and select the one that interests you the most.
2. Create a public repository on your GitHub profile with the name of the chosen assignment.
3. Implement the home assignment in your repository.
4. Return here and create a pull request to add your implementation to the submissions list.
5. Seek feedback from the Imagine community! Let's learn from each other!
6. Discuss your submission with your tech coach or other fellows over at Imagine's Slack!

If you can't find a task that is sutiable for your experience, Let us know! We are working on increasing the number of projects in here!
